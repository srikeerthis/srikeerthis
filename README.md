## 🚀 Projects

### 🔎 Semantic Search using PostgreSQL

- Developed a **Flask API** that performs semantic search using embeddings and cosine similarity.
- Achieved 5% faster retrieval by storing embeddings with the **PGVector** extension in PostgreSQL.
- Enhanced search operations for large datasets with efficient indexing.

### 🛠 ETL Data Pipeline

- Engineered a scalable **batch processing pipeline** using **AWS Lambda**.
- Validated and transferred CSV files from **S3** into **DynamoDB** for efficient data handling.
- Implemented **AWS Secrets Manager** for secure credential management.

### 🤖 Computer Vision for Healthcare

- Created a **computer vision-based model** to manage over 100+ patients in physiotherapy.
- Reduced costs by 5% through automation and improved accuracy.
- Deployed an AI algorithm with 95% accuracy for real-time interpretation of medical device readings.

### 🗺️ 3D Neighborhood Reconstruction

- Reconstructed 2D neighborhood maps into 3D layouts with 90% accuracy using **ArcGIS Pro** and **Mask R-CNN**.
- Provided insights for urban planning by analyzing critical infrastructure.

## 👐 Open Source Contributions

- Actively participated in events like **Open Source Day**, **Hacktoberfest**, and **Common Voice Sprint**.
- Contributed to communities such as **Open Source Lab**, **VVCE**, and **Mobi at UTA**.
- Organized workshops and training sessions to promote open-source development and social coding.
